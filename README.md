## Android Developer - About Me

In my spare time I like to play video games, read fantasy books, make games with [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/), and spend time with my family.

I'm an ever learning developer. At some point months back I've learned I can do anything I set my mind to. All I need is google! I find that when I start working away coding hours can go by without me even realizing it.
