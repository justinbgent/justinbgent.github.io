## About Me
I'm an ever learning and improving android developer. I make apps that make life more convenient for whatever it may be. For whatever you can imagine, websites, games and the list gets bigger.
On my spare time I like to play video games, read fantasy books, make games with [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/), and spend time with my family.
